## Class of 2017.2: Projects with PIC microprocessor.

Professor: Hari Mohr

This class consists of a bunch of small projects in PIC microprocessor ending in a bigger project.

We only utilize Proteus to emulate the microprocessor.

## Tools:
	* Sublime Text 3 (coding)
	* MPLab IDE v8.70 (debugging)
