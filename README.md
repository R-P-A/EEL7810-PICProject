# EEL7810-PICProject
## Class of 2017.2: Projects with PIC microprocessor.

Professor: Hari Mohr

This class consists of a bunch of small projects in PIC microprocessor ending in a bigger project.

We only utilize Proteus to emulate the microprocessor.

## Tools:

* [Sublime Text 3 (coding)](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [MPLab IDE v8.70](http://www.microchip.com/development-tools/downloads-archive) (debugging)
* [CCS Optimizing C Compiler](http://www.ccsinfo.com/ccsfreedemo.php)
* Proteus (ISIS) for the emulations
