# EEL7810-PICProject
## Class of 2017.2: Projects with PIC microprocessor.

Professor: Hari Mohr

This class consists of a bunch of small projects in PIC microprocessor ending in a bigger project.

We only utilize Proteus to emulate the microprocessor.

## Tools:

* [Sublime Text 3 (coding)](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
* [MPLAB X IDE v4.01](http://www.microchip.com/development-tools/downloads-archive) (debugging)
* [MPLAB XC8 Compiler v1.43](http://www.microchip.com/mplab/compilers)
* Proteus (ISIS) for the emulations
